    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I am Francesco Russo, an Electronic Engineer with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Catania and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Control Engineering at La Sapienza University in Rome. My academic journey has been focused on control systems, robotics, and neural interfaces, with a particular emphasis on safety-critical systems and human-robot interaction. My research interests include brain-computer interfaces, UAV control, and safety management in autonomous systems. I combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation skills, demonstrated through various projects including a BCI-controlled quadrotor and a self-balancing robot.",
