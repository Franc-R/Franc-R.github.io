    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "My name is Francesco Russo, and I am an electronic engineer graduated from the University of Catania. Currently, I am a graduate student in Control Engineering at La Sapienza University in Rome. I have a strong passion for dynamic systems, with a particular focus on robotics and drones. Recently, I have been working on an exciting project involving the development of a drone controlled through brain waves, combining my interests in neural interfaces and autonomous flight. I am motivated by the challenge of integrating cutting-edge technology with innovative control systems to push the boundaries of what drones can achieve.",
