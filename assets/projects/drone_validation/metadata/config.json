  "title": "Design and Experimental Validation of a UAV Platform",
  "description": "In this project, a 7-inch Crocodile frame drone was customized by designing and producing in 3D components such as landing gear and mounts for the RealSense T265 camera, Jetson Nano, PX4 6C flight controller, and ESCs. A Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) localization solution was integrated, enabling the drone to estimate its position indoors where GPS signals and external motion capture systems are unavailable. The work encompassed both hardware and software aspects, ensuring stable and accurate flight performance even without external references.",
