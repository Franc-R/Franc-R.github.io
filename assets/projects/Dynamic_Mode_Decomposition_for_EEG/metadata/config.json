    "description": "Neural recordings are essential for investigating the nervous system. Although they typically generate data in a high-dimensional space, their underlying structure often lies in a low-dimensional one. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is used to construct reduced-order representations of these data, enabling extraction of meaningful spatio-temporal patterns from large-scale neural recordings.",
