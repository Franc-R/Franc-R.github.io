    "description": "Neural recordings are essential for investigating the nervous system. Although they typically generate data that reside in a high-dimensional space, their underlying structure often lies in a low-dimensional one. Thus, the Dynamic Mode Decomposition technique is used to construct a reduced-order representation of these data, enabling the extraction of meaningful spatio-temporal patterns from large-scale neural recordings.",
