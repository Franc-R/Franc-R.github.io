    "title": "Two Wheels Self-Balancing Robot",
    "description": "The aim of the project was to build a wheeled robot, designed with Autodesk Inventor and manufactured using a 3D printer, capable of autonomously maintaining balance. This was achieved by designing a controller implemented on an Arduino Nano, able to asymptotically stabilize the systemâ€™s equilibrium point.",
