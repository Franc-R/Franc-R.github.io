    "title": "Two Wheels Self-Balancing Robot",
    "description": "The aim of the project was to build a wheeled robot, designed with Autodesk Inventor and manufactured using a 3D printer, capable of autonomously maintaining balance. This was achieved by designing a PID controller implemented on an Arduino Nano, able to asymptotically stabilize the system’s equilibrium point.",

        "challenge": "Accurately measuring the robot’s tilt angle was challenging due to sensor noise. A simple low-pass filter was insufficient, so we implemented a Kalman filter to effectively reduce noise and obtain reliable angle measurements.",
        "solution": "Designed and implemented a PID controller on Arduino Nano, using data from an MPU6050 IMU sensor. The controller stabilized the robot by continuously adjusting motor outputs based on filtered angle feedback.",
