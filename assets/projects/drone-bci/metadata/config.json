    "description": " Master’s degree thesis focuses on the design and control of an underactuated quadrotor controlled through brain–computer interface signals, where a safety critical controller was implemented to ensure that the system operates within a predefined safe set. A novel trust-based approach was proposed to dynamically evaluate the reliability of the BCI signal before execution.",
