    "title": " Safety Management and Trust beetween Humans and Robots in BCI system",
    "description": " Master’s degree thesis focuses on the design and control of an underactuated quadrotor controlled through brain–computer interface signals, where a safety critical controller was implemented to ensure that the system operates within a predefined safe set. A novel trust-based approach was proposed to dynamically evaluate the reliability of the BCI signal before execution. Additionally, the physical platform was customized using 3D-printed components designed in Fusion 360, and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) was integrated to enable robust indoor localization.",
