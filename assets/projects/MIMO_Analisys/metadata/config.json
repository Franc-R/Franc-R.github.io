    "description": "The goal of the project was to analyse the directional properties of MIMO systems, and assess how ill-conditioned the system is, by means Singular Value Decomposition. It also aimed to design an ùêª-infinity controller capable of robustly stabilising the MIMO system, taking into account both structured and unstructured uncertainties.",
