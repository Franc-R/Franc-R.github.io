    "title": " DC-Motor Velocity Control Problem",
    "description": " The goal of the project was to design a controller capable of driving the rotor of a DC motor at steady state and at a given angular velocity, while rejecting noise and attenuating disturbances through a closed-loop approach. The design involved minimizing the ùêª-infinity norm of the sensitivity, complementary sensitivity, and control sensitivity functions.",
